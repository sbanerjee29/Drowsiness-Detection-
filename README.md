## Project Name: Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview:

This project aims to develop a drowsiness detection system that monitors a person's alertness level in real-time, primarily targeting drivers to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system detects signs of drowsiness based on facial expressions and eye movements.

## Features:

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors the driver's facial features and eye behavior in real-time.
Alert Generation: Generates alerts or warnings when signs of drowsiness are detected, prompting the driver to take necessary actions.
Customization: Adjustable sensitivity levels and alert mechanisms to accommodate individual preferences and environments.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for easy interaction and configuration.
Compatibility: Compatible with standard webcams or smartphone cameras for seamless integration into various platforms.

## Usage:

Setup: Position the camera to capture the driver's face clearly.
Run Application: Launch the drowsiness detection application.
Monitor Alertness: Keep an eye on the alertness level displayed by the system.
Respond to Alerts: Take appropriate actions prompted by the system's alerts, such as taking a break or switching drivers.
Installation:
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure compatible versions of Python and required libraries are installed.
